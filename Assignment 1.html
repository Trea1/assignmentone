<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahomey_Amazons'>Dahomey Amazons Biography</a>
<p>We've heard of or seen the Dora Milaje of Black Panther and the Amazons in Wonder Woman but did you know that both of these were inspired in part by a real life all woman African Army? The Dahomey Amazons, an 18th to 19th century army of all female warriors that existed in present day Benin. They were called the Dahomey Amazons because of ther similarity with the Amazons of Greek mythology and were a force to be recokened with. They trained with intense physical exercise, learned survival skills and because discipline was heavily emphasized, they were taught to be indifferent to pain and death. For example, when a French naval officer visited the kingdom, he watched as a teenage recruit walked up to a prisoner, swung her sword three times and calmly cut his head off. <br> When not being at war, being a Dahomean female warrior was quite all right. They were wealthy, held high status, and even debated policies of the kingdom. In fact, they were held to such high esteem that whenever they walked out of the palace, a sound told every man to get out of their path, keep a distance and look the other way. To even touch them meant death.</p>
